An intuitive package manager that works everywhere.

## Installation

- **Not Windows**: Open up a terminal and enter `wget -qO- https://getcone.org/install.sh | sudo bash`

## Adding a package

You can simply [open an issue](https://github.com/hell-sh/Cone/issues/new) with a link to the project and other information you consider relevant.

Alternatively, you can have a look at the `packages.json` in `%ProgramFiles%\Hell.sh\Cone` or `/usr/share/cone`, try to add working instructions for the project (and its dependencies, if needed), and open a pull request.
